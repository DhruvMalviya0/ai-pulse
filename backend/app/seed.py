"""Creates demo data. Run: python -m app.seed

All passwords are: pulse123

The data is shaped to exercise the minimum group size rule (5):
- Northwind Sales (5 respondents) and Support (6) are shown on their own.
- Northwind Engineering (3) + HR (2) are pooled into "Other teams" (5).
- Bluepeak has only 2 respondents, so its dashboard shows no scores at all.
