"""My feature. Policy reality check: does what people *say* about the AI policy match how they handle data?

Built only from answers we already collect:
- "says they follow it": common-policy answered "Yes, and I follow it" or "...help others follow it"
- "unaware":             common-policy answered "I don't know" or "I think so, but I haven't read it"
- "risky practice":      common-data answered "I don't think about it" or "Rarely",
                         OR the open answer was flagged for sharing customer/confidential data

The interesting group is people who say they follow the policy AND show risky practice:
the policy exists and people believe in it, but it isn't changing behaviour. That's a
different fix (practical training, approved tools) from people who've never read it.
